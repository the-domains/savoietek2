We approach our craft with a "bag of tricks" acquired throughout our 40 year Alaska experience. The graphic representation reflects the portion of tools used professionally in television production, photography and print production, and web design taking centre stage.

Savoie Tek is an Alaskan full service agency without the ad agency price. We offer a wide variety of graphic design services, including logos, catalogs, brochures, trade show displays, direct mail pieces, and web design. You can also take advantage of the branding solutions we offer, such as promotional products, corporate apparel, and trade show displays. We also provide media buying services, such as cable and broadcast television and radio commercials; and newspaper and billboard advertisements. Most importantly, we create marketing & advertising solutions to suit your budget.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e0e7755e-c792-4c7e-85fc-bcce2a756bff.png"></article>]]></description>
